## Analysis and results scripts for the Biogeography of Tropical Asia project

## - Origins and Assembly analyses

Scripts to carry out analyses for the 'Origins and Assembly' section of Lim et al. 'The rich, unique, and threatened biodiversity of tropical Asia'. For three higher taxa (plants, tetrapods, and teleost fish), we iterate through each family and genus to determine the number of taxa endemic to tropical Asia, their crown and stem ages from 100 phylogenetic trees from corresponding posterior distributions, and their habitat affinities: montane, tropical rainforest, or tropical seasonal for terrestrial taxa; reef-associated versus pelagic for marine taxa.

# Spatial and Biological Information

We use biodiversity distribution data from published sources. As we don't own the underlying data, in each case you will need to access the data sources from the data provider outlined in the Supplementary Material. This may also be the case for the taxonomic information if the spatial data does not have all the relevant information. 

You will also need some other published spatial data sources, such as polygons of botanical countries from the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (WGSRPD), elevation from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Koppen climate maps from Beck et al. 2018 (doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.214).
