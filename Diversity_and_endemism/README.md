## Analysis and results scripts for the Biogeography of Tropical Asia project

## - Diversity and endemism analyses

Scripts to carry out analyses for the 'Diversity and endemism' section of Lim et al. 'The rich, unique, and threatened biodiversity of tropical Asia'. First, we generate checklists of species present in each subregion, then these are summarised to create the tables and figures in the manuscript.

Also runs the 'Rates of species discoveryâ€™ analyses.

### 1. Species intersections with tropical Asia and subregions

Scripts inside the folder 'Intersections'.

Processes the biodiversity data (rangemaps, checklists or occurrence data) to generate a species list for each subregion. Each taxon has a separate script (note, some groups may take a week or more to run depending on how many threads you have).

As we don't own the underlying data, in each case you will need to access the data sources from the data provider outlined in the Supplementary Material. This may also be the case for the taxonomic information if the spatial data does not have all the relevant information (e.g. the description year). You will also need some other spatial data sources, such as GADM 4.1 for coastline data or hydroBASINs data from the IUCN, outlined below. Other spatial data required are in the folder 'Data'.

*IMPORTANT: to fully replicate the exact results you will need the same versions as the ones outlined at the top of each script. Using more recent versions may result in differing results.*

Input data required (depends on taxon):

-   various spatial data (e.g. shapefiles with the subregions) stored in folder 'Data'.

-   the biodiversity data source (outlined at top of each script).

-   if necessary, a separate taxonomy information source for description dates and higher-order taxonomic information (outlined at top of each script).

-   You will need to create a version of GADM called 'GADM_410_land_Equal_Area.gpkg'. This is simply the global GADM that has been unioned (i.e. all land borders removed) and reprojected to that of the rest of the project: World Cylindrical Equal Area (+proj=cea +lat_ts=0 +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs). This is to act as a mask on top of the range maps to remove parts of range that fall in ocean areas. You may need to do some manual cleaning within New Guinea and a few other locations where the internal borders within GADM have not been aligned properly.

-   HydroBASINS data (2023/08 version) available on the IUCN website. You will need levels 08, 10 and 12 - see <https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download>

-   The GBIF taxonomic backbone - available at <https://www.gbif.org/dataset/d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c>

-   WoRMS taxonomic data - request here <https://www.marinespecies.org/usersrequest.php>

### 2. Summarise diversity and endemism in tropical Asia and subregions

Once all intersections have been run results can be summarised across the region. The two scripts necessary are in the folder 'Endemicity'.

-   First, 'calc_endemicity.R' will read in the intersections files inside the folder 'Intersections/Intersections', and summarise richness and endemicity for tropical Asia, and for each subregion. Results are saved as .csv files in the folder 'Results'. Diversity and endemicity are calculated at the taxon-level, and also summarised across the four taxonomic groups.

-   'plot_endemicity.R' generates the figures in the main manuscript and supplementary material, and writes them to the folder 'Figures'.

### 3. Description rates

Requires the file 'Endemicity/taxon_full_list.csv' generated from 'calc_endemicity.R' in step 2.\
\
Generates species discovery curves and description rates (based on the year that each specific epithet was described) for each taxon, as well as summarised for taxonomic groups.
